 	<h1 id="iheading">PROCEDURE</h1>
 	<ol>
 		<li>Prepare the filling
 			<ul type="square">
				<li>To make delicious Aloo Parathas, boil the potatoes at least a few hours before you plan to make the parathas, mash them in a large bowl and cover and refrigerate. 
				<li>Take them out from the fridge and add chopped onions, coriander leaves, salt, garam masala powder and red chilli powder.
				<li> Mix well so that no lumps remain. Ensure that you have finely chopped the onions or the filling will fall out.
				</li></li></li></ul>
			</li>
		
		<li>Knead a soft dough and roll a chapati and fill with the stuffing
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl.
				<li>Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough.
				<li> Make small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. 
				<li>Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre.
				<li> Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas.
				<li> Be very careful to apply pressure evenly.
				<li> It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able to make perfect parathas. 
				<li>Seal the dough and round it with your fingers.
				<li>Now, roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas. <li>Apply the pressure very evenly and gently on all sides.
				<li>Press very lightly so that the mixture does not come out.
				</li></li></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Pan fry the Aloo Paratha
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Heat an iron tawa and roast the parathas, cooking them on both sides with a spoonful of ghee. 
				<li>If you want to use less ghee on the parathas, first roast them on both sides on low flame and when they are slightly crispy, apply ghee with a kitchen brush on both sides.
				<li> You must keep the flame low.
				</li></li></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Serve hot with curd, pickle and chutney
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Serve piping hot parathas with chilled yoghurt or pickle. 
				<li>You can also serve the aloo parathas with green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy.
				<li>Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka paratha.
				<li> You can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with this paratha.
